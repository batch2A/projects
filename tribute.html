    <h2>Early life-</h2>
    <p>
    <h3>
        Bhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Jat Sikh family on 27 September 1907 in the
        village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan;
        he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan
        Singh Sandhu.
        Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation
        around the
        Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghadar_Movement">Ghadar
            Movement</a> of 1914–1915

        <p>
            After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand
            Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.
            In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore
        </p>
        <p>He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger
            strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a
            household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in
            Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, the charismatic Bhagat Singh
            electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s and prompted urgent introspection within the <a

                Saunders in Lahore, Punjab. The revolutionaries mistook Saunders for James Scott, the police
